•	Explain how to use AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) and relational databases for basic cloud storage. <br>
•	Complete an analysis of an Amazon customer review.


## Discussion
1. Perform the ETL process completely in the cloud and upload a DataFrame to an RDS instance. 
2. Use PySpark or SQL to perform a statistical analysis (NLP pipeline) of selected data
